# DL_CNN_Breast_Can_-Det
 We experimented with three transfer models (Resnet50, EfficientNetB7, and VGG16), and after rigorous testing, we chose VGG16 with frozen pretrained layers as our final model. VGG16 demonstrated the highest test score for predicting cancer tissues, showcasing robustness with smaller training-validation gaps.
